# brute_force_caeser_decryptor

A Python-based tool for decrypting messages encoded with the Caesar Cipher.
Users can either input a known shift value or let the program brute-force all possible shifts to reveal the plaintext.

I have just arrived at the realisation that I have spelt 'Caesar' wrong everywhere! Oops!

# Features

Decrypts Caesar Cipher messages with a specified shift.
Brute-force mode to try all possible shifts automatically.
Interactive command-line interface for ease of use.

Successfully tested using NCSC's Caesar Cypher Exercises at https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/ECW21-UoS-Cipher-Challenge-Student-Worksheet.pdf5

# Contributions

I previously attempted to add functionality for shifting non-alphabetic characters, but it didnâ€™t work as expected.
